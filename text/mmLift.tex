\begin{document}

In September, and November, 2023, respectively, the City of Vancouver and then the Province of British Columbia enabled multiplex options in neighbourhoods formerly limited to duplexes in Vancouver and single family homes (sometimes with duplexes) in most of the rest of the province. Additionally, in the November 2023 legislation, the Province mandated minimums for allowable density near transit stations which in some instances allowed dramatically more density than current zoning in various affected municipalities.
